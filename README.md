# OCEAN-Analyzer-Bot

This is a rule-based personality quiz bot web app built with Python and Gradio that analyzes a user's personality based on the OCEAN (Big Five Personality Traits/FFM) model.

- *O*penness  
- *C*onscientiousness  
- *E*xtraversion  
- *A*greeableness  
- *N*euroticism  

It asks 10 weighted questions, calculates scores for each trait, and gives Trait-by-trait feedback (Low/Medium/High).
